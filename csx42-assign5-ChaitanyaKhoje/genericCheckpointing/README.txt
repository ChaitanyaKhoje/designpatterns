This assignment's submission is my own work and I did not discuss with any other past or current student, nor did I have access to a previous submission of this assignment by another student.

Assuming you are in the directory containing this README:

## To clean:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml clean

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To compile:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

## To generate documentation
ant -buildfile src/build.xml doc

(Javadocs is generated by the above command on src folder's level)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To run by specifying arguments from command line
## We will use this to run your code
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=0
or
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=1
or
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## To create tarball for submission
tar -cvf Chaitanya_Khoje_assign5.tar Chaitanya_Khoje_assign5/
gzip Chaitanya_Khoje_assign5.tar

"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense."

Project synopsis:

The random values which are being passed to the constructor of MyAllTypes classes in Driver code have a particular range set to them.
Completely random values will lead to excessive mismatched objects or the probability of values being negative is higher as well.
So the range of the values is between 1 to 30. So random numbers will be generated in between this range,
and there's also a chance of getting values below 10. So negative numbers will not be generated.
Also, only a random integer is generated between 1-30 (say 20), rest of the data types take the same random variable. So if the int is 20, the long will
be 20 as well. BUT, if int is 20 and the long is < 10 (say 9), there will be a mismatch as it is written to the file as 0;
(0 being the default value if it is below threshold of 10).

Assumption:

In "deser" mode, if the file can yield to, say 10 objects and we pass the NUM_OF_OBJECTS = 1, then the loop for deser will run twice, as it is 2 * NUM_OF_OBJECTS
So out of those 10, only 2 will be deserialized and added to the list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

TEST OUTPUT:
If the file is not found, a new file named checkpoint.txt is created on src level (irrespective of mode run serdeser/deser).
A file not found error is displayed along with a message asking to run the program again.
If program is run again, checkpoint.txt is empty as it was just created, and the output is empty.
If program is run on serdeser, checkpoint.txt is serialized and deserialized.
